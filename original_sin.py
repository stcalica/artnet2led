WS2812B DMX Integration Controller

---
PHYSICAL SETUP & NETWORKING CONTEXT
---
This script is designed for a setup where:
- A Raspberry Pi (running this script) is connected via Ethernet to a Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) switch.
- The PoE switch provides both data (Ethernet network) and power to an array of fixtures (e.g., WLED-based LED controllers) that support PoE and Art-Net/UDP control.

How this works in practice:
- **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as the controller, sending UDP packets (broadcast for discovery, unicast for control) over the wired network.
- **PoE Switch**: Forwards all Ethernet frames between devices. For broadcast packets (like device discovery), the switch sends the packet to all connected devices. For unicast packets (like Art-Net control to a specific fixture), it sends only to the target device.
- **Fixtures**: Each fixture is a network device with its own IP address, powered and networked via a single Ethernet cable. They listen for Art-Net packets and discovery messages.

**Networking Concepts:**
- **Ethernet Switch**: Unlike a hub, a switch learns which devices (MAC addresses) are on which ports and forwards unicast packets only to the correct port. Broadcast packets (like discovery) are sent to all ports.
- **PoE (Power over Ethernet)**: Allows both power and data to be delivered over the same cable, simplifying wiring for fixtures.
- **UDP Broadcast**: Used for device discovery. The Pi sends a packet to the broadcast address; the switch delivers it to all devices.
- **UDP Unicast**: Used for Art-Net control. The Pi sends a packet to a specific fixture's IP; the switch delivers it only to that device.

This setup is robust for lighting control because:
- Wired Ethernet is reliable and low-latency (important for real-time lighting effects).
- PoE reduces cabling complexity.
- The switch ensures efficient delivery of both broadcast and unicast packets.

LIMITATIONS, REQUIREMENTS, AND CONSIDERATIONS
---
1. This script is designed to control WS2812B (addressable RGB LED) fixtures using WLED firmware over a local network.
2. It uses UDP broadcast to discover WLED devices and sends Art-Net packets to control them.
3. The script assumes all WLED devices are on the same local network and are discoverable via UDP broadcast.
4. Only two patterns are implemented: 'chase' and 'strobe'.
5. The script does not handle more than 170 pixels per Art-Net universe (a DMX512/Art-Net limitation).
6. No error handling for network issues, device timeouts, or packet loss beyond basic socket timeouts.
7. Requires Python 3 and access to the 'socket', 'json', 'time', and 'struct' libraries (all standard in Python).
8. The script must be run on a machine connected to the same network as the WLED devices.
9. This script is for educational/demo purposes and is not production-hardened.
10. You may need to run as administrator/root to send broadcast packets, depending on your OS/network settings.

# --- DMX/Art-Net/Universe Explanation ---
# DMX512 is a protocol for lighting control that allows 512 channels per 'universe'.
# Each RGB LED pixel requires 3 channels (one for Red, one for Green, one for Blue).
# 512 / 3 = 170.666..., so you can control up to 170 RGB pixels per universe (510 channels used, 2 unused).
# Art-Net is a protocol for sending DMX data over Ethernet networks. Each Art-Net 'universe' is a separate DMX512 stream.
# If a fixture has more than 170 pixels, you must split its data across multiple universes (Art-Net packets),
# and the fixture must be configured to listen to those universes and map them to its pixel buffer.
# This script splits each fixture's data into 170-pixel chunks and sends each chunk as a separate Art-Net packet.
# The send_artnet() function should be updated to accept a universe parameter and use it in the Art-Net header for full support.
# WLED can be configured to listen to multiple universes and map them to its LEDs in the web UI.

    Send Art-Net DMX data to a WLED fixture.
    Concept: Art-Net is a protocol for sending DMX512 lighting data over Ethernet networks. Each Art-Net packet contains a header (with protocol info, universe number, etc.) and a payload (the DMX channel data for up to 512 channels). Each fixture listens to a specific universe and updates its LEDs based on the DMX data in packets for that universe.
    ELI5: This function puts the color info for each LED into a special envelope (Art-Net packet) and sends it to the right light (by IP and universe).

    - data: List of RGB values (flattened).

    # --- ART-NET PACKET STRUCTURE ---
    # An Art-Net packet is a binary message with a specific structure:
    #   - Header: Identifies the packet as Art-Net, specifies the operation (OpCode), protocol version, sequence, physical port, universe, and data length.
    #   - Payload: The DMX channel data (up to 512 bytes, one per channel).

    # '>8sHHBBBBH' means:
    #   8s: 8-byte string ("Art-Net\0")

    #   H: unsigned short (Protocol version)
    #   B: unsigned char (Sequence)
    #   B: unsigned char (Physical)
    #   B: unsigned char (Universe low byte)
    #   B: unsigned char (Universe high byte)
    #   H: unsigned short (Length of DMX data)
    #
    # Art-Net universe is a 16-bit number (0-32767) that identifies a specific DMX data stream.
    # The protocol splits this into two bytes for transmission:
    #   - universe_low: least significant 8 bits (0-255)
    #   - universe_high: most significant 8 bits (0-255)
    # When combined, (universe_high << 8) | universe_low gives the full universe number.
    # Fixtures are configured to listen to specific universes; only packets with matching universe numbers are used.
    # This allows you to control many fixtures or split large fixtures across multiple universes.
    # Example: If universe = 0x1234 (4660 decimal), universe_low = 0x34, universe_high = 0x12.
    #
    # Math explanation:
    #   - universe_low = universe & 0xFF: This masks out all but the lowest 8 bits (e.g., 0x1234 & 0xFF = 0x34)
